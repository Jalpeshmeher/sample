The Big Bang
The universe began as a dense, tiny fireball that exploded 13.8 billion years ago. The Big Bang created hydrogen and helium, which would later form the solar system.

<p class="abc"> Solar system formation </p>
A giant cloud of gas and dust, called the solar nebula, began to contract and rotate. The cloud flattened into a disk, and denser regions formed. Over millions of years, planets, moons, and other objects formed in the disk.

Earth formation
Earth formed from dust and gas around the young sun. Collisions between dust particles, asteroids, and other growing planets caused Earth to grow larger. A giant impact created enough rock, gas, and dust to form the moon.
